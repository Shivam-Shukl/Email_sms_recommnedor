# Spam Classifier – InboxGuard

InboxGuard is a simple yet powerful spam classification web application. It leverages machine learning to detect whether a given SMS message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**. Built with Flask and scikit-learn, it provides an intuitive web interface where users can input any message and receive a prediction instantly.

## 🏗 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: SMS data is cleaned and transformed using `TfidfVectorizer`.
2. **Model Training**: A `Multinomial Naive Bayes` classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.
3. **Prediction**: The model predicts whether the input message is spam or not.
4. **Deployment**: The model and vectorizer are saved with `pickle` and used in a Flask app.
